"The USTC Odyssey" is a campus growth simulation game that draws inspiration from the experiences of me and my fellow classmates at USTC. In this game, players have the freedom to tailor their initial student characters, customizing attributes such as gender, personality, skills, and major. They can meticulously orchestrate the daily lives of their characters, make pivotal decisions, and immerse themselves in the distinctive and exhilarating campus environment of USTC.

The narrative unfolds in chronological order, encompassing the journey from freshman to senior year, with storylines structured on a weekly basis. The diverse choices players make result in a myriad of attribute enhancements and open doors to encounters with new characters and the initiation of unique story arcs.

USTC stands as one of China's premier educational institutions, where students harbor lofty aspirations for their futures. Consequently, our game serves not only as a source of entertainment but also as a valuable tool to guide underclassmen in charting their own paths to success.
